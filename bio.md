-----------------------------------------------------------------
Born in Iwakuni-city, Japan, I spent my childhood there. When I was four years old, our family moved to Chiba Prefecture because of my father's job which is chemical engineer. Our family loved travel, so we went to almost all [Kanto areas](https://www.jetro.go.jp/en/ind_tourism/kanto.html) by car, which were a highly pleasurable experience for me.
