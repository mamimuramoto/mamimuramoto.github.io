         <p>Freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose.:<br>
         <i>--Janis Joplin--</i></p>
         <hr>
         <p>The chains that keep us from true freedom are bad experiences of  the past, good experiences of:<br>
            the past, fears and anxieties about the future, ambitions for the futures, clinging to present things,:<br>
            and delusions about our own importance.</p>
         <i>--Anthony DeMello</i>
         <hr>
         <p>Freedom is the opportunity to create my own circumstances.:<br>
            Such as going to school after being adult or studying new things are.</p>
